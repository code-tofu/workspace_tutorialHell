"""
The Coleman-Liau index of a text is designed to output that (U.S.) grade level that is needed to understand some text.
The formula is index = 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8
where L is the average number of letters per 100 words in the text,
and S is the average number of sentences per 100 words in the text.

You may assume that a sentence:
will contain at least one word;
will not start or end with a space; and
will not have multiple spaces in a row.
Consider letters to be uppercase or lowercase alphabetical character, not punctuation, digits, or other symbols.
Consider any sequence of characters that ends with a . or a ! or a ? to be a sentence
But of course, not all periods necessarily mean the sentence is over.
For this problem, weâ€™ll ask you to ignore that subtlety
